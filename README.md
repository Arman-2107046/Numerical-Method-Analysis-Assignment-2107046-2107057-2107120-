<h4>Included methods--</h4>
1.Runge Kutta Method<br>
<p>The Runge-Kutta method is a straightforward and effective way to solve ordinary differential equations when you can’t find exact solutions. It works by taking several measurements of how the function is changing at different points during each step, then combining those measurements to get a better estimate of the function’s next value. The fourth-order version, often called RK4, is especially popular because it strikes a good balance between accuracy and ease of use. It’s commonly used in various fields like physics, engineering, and finance to model complex systems.</p>

2.Newton Forward Backward Interpolation Method<br>
<p>
Newton's Forward and Backward Interpolation Methods are handy tools for estimating the values of a function when you only have a few known data points. Forward Interpolation is great for when you want to find a value within the range of your data, using a polynomial based on the starting points. On the other hand, Backward Interpolation works well when you're looking for a value near the end of your data set, relying on the last points to create its polynomial. Both methods use divided differences to build these polynomials, making them effective for filling in gaps in your data and getting a better sense of the function's behavior.</p>
